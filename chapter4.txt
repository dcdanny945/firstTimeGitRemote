I had a great day of napping till Danny came home. He woke me up and all wet from the water. He splashed some on me when he took of his jacket and I ran away.
I mewoed at him to tell me that I wanted to go out. He opened the silding door of balcony. It seems some water was pouring from the sky. He carried me out and the water got on me. I jumpe back to my comfy couch.
